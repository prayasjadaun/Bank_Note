# Bank_Note

🗂️ Project Overview¶
Objective: Utilize statistical features extracted from image data represented in the columns VWTI, SWTI, CWTI, and EI to perform a classification task denoted by the 'Class' column.

📝 Summary
VWTI (Variance of Wavelet Transformed Image): Represents the variance of wavelet transformed images, indicating the spread of pixel values.
SWTI (Skewness of Wavelet Transformed Image): Denotes the asymmetry of pixel intensity distribution in the wavelet transformed images.
CWTI (Curtosis of Wavelet Transformed Image): Indicates the tailedness or sharpness of pixel intensity distribution in the wavelet transformed images.
EI (Entropy of Image): Measures the randomness or unpredictability within the images.
Class: A categorical feature defining the authenticity of banknotes, likely representing fake or genuine notes.
